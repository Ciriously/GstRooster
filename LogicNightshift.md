### Night Shift Assignment for L1 and L2 Positions for 2024

Here's a detailed plan for assigning the night shift for the rest of the year 2024:

#### **Assignment Plan**

1. **L1 and L2 Distribution:**
   - **L1 Positions:** 10
   - **L2 Positions:** 4

2. **Fresher Definition:**
   - A fresher is defined as an employee who joined within the last 8 months from the current date. 

3. **Night Shift Assignment Strategy:**

   - **Monthly Assignment:**
     - **Freshers First:** For each month, the night shift should first be assigned to freshers among L1 positions.
     - **Selection Criteria:** The number of freshers to select for the night shift is not predefined and may vary.
     - **Post-Freshers:** After assigning the night shift to all eligible freshers, continue to assign the remaining night shifts to L1 employees who have not received a night shift in the past 12 months.

   - **Fresher Identification:**
     - Calculate freshers based on their joining date relative to the current month. Only those who joined within the past 8 months are considered freshers.

   - **Fallback Strategy:**
     - If there are not enough freshers to fill the night shift slots, proceed by selecting employees who have not received a night shift in the past 12 months.

#### **Process Flow**

1. **Generate Button Action:**
   - Upon clicking the "Generate" button, the system will:
     - **Filter L1 Employees:** Identify and list all L1 freshers based on their joining date.
     - **Assign Night Shifts:** Allocate the night shift to these freshers as a priority.
     - **Scan for Remaining Freshers:** If the number of freshers is insufficient, continue to assign the night shift to L1 employees who have not received it in the past 12 months.

2. **Monthly Update:**
   - This process will repeat monthly for the rest of the year, ensuring freshers are prioritized and that no employee receives the night shift more frequently than allowed.

By adhering to this plan, the night shift assignments will be distributed fairly among freshers and other employees, while also meeting the organizational requirements for shift scheduling.
